#+TITLE: blog-example

Example implementation of [[html://github.com/michieljoris/bb-blog][bb-blog]] which is blogging extension for [[html://github.com/michieljoris/bb-server][bb-server]] and
[[http://github.com/michieljoris/html-builder][html-builder]], producing post pages, widgets, landing/latest, archive
and tag pages. Pagination is added when there are more post teasers than fit on
a page. Comments from Disqus can be enabled for all or per post. Also a little
crud api is implemented so the blog could be managed from the site where the
blog is implemented.

Clone the repo:

: git clone git@github.com:Michieljoris/blog-example.git

Then:

: cd blog-example
: bin/serve

Open your browser at [[http://localhost:9100][localhost:9100]].

Open the file at server/blog-config.js to configure the blog and restart the
server. So kill the serve process and again =bin/serve=.
