<pre>published: yes
title:Blog manual
comments: no</pre><p>I tried to keep the system as much as possible as what's already in place for editing the rest of the site, which means you can click on any blog post when you're logged in and you can edit them the way edit the rest of the site.</p><p>The blog consists of blog pages and of overview pages. The overview pages list posts by tag, year/month or latest posts. On these overview pages posts are shown in abbreviated form, that is only a teaser is shown with a 'more' link that takes you to the full posts when clicked. When viewing the full post you can edit/delete it.</p><p>Buttons</p><p>On the post pages you have 3 new buttons: new, delete and render.</p><p>New button:</p><p>When you click the new button you will be asked for a title of your new post. This can be changed afterwards, so you're not stuck with the title you enter here. This will refresh the page with your new (empty) post. Write the post and save.</p><p>Delete button:</p><p>This will of course just delete the post.</p><p>Render button:</p><p>Strictly speaking this button shouldn't be necessary to click, however, if you think something is not right or missing click this button to render the whole blog from scratch. After rerendering the landing page with latest posts will be opened (firstdoor.com.au/blog).</p><p>Widgets</p><p>On every blog page there are 3 widgets: recent, tags and archive, plus one more widget: unpublished. These widgets are generated automatically from the posts in the blog. </p><p>Recent widget:</p><p>List of most recent blogs, listed by published date. I can adjust the number of recent posts to list. </p><p>Tags widget:</p><p>Listing of the tags used in posts, with the number of posts tagged with a particular tag in brackets after the tag, again we can list more or fewer tags.</p><p>Archive widget:</p><p>Listing of all posts grouped by year and month. If you click on a year or month you will get the posts (teasers) for that year or month.</p><p>Unpublished widget:</p><p>This widget lists all the posts that have been entered but are not published. Unpublished posts are not listed in the other widgets.</p><p>Post settings:</p><p>Every post can be assigned some data that isn't shown directly to the public but is being used to tag, name and date a post.</p><p>This exra post information is entered at the top of the post, in a special block. If you by accident delete this block you can recreate it by writing the information, highlighting it and click the far right button on the editor toolbar, it looks like this: &lt;&gt;.</p><p>This block is only shown when logged in.</p><p>The following info can be set:</p><p>title: The title of your post</p><p>published: yes or no or true or false or just leave it out all together</p><p>comments: yes or no or true or false or just leave it out all together</p><p>publishedat: some data such as 11/Jan/2014</p><p>tags: tag1,tag2 tag3 tag4 flower dog,etc </p><p>You can capitalize whatever words you like, also as long as the date is readable to you the  system should be able to read it. All entries are optional. If you leave out the title, the post will take on the name the system uses for the post.</p><p>Title</p><p>If you change the title of a post, the url or web address will change as well, so anybody linking to the old web address it will end up with a dead link. You will have to save the post to change the title.</p><p>Published</p><p>Enter yes or true to publish a post, or any value other than no or false. The publish date will set when you change this for the first time from no or false to for example yes. Published posts will also show up in the widgets.  If you would like to explicitly set the published date set the following property:</p><p>Publishedat: </p><p>A date that is used to archive the post. This date is also shown above the post. If not entered the system will use the date that the post was first published by changing the Published property.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>When true  or yes, or rather any value except for no or false, blog viewers can enter comments to posts. This is outsourced with Disqus. On the Disqus site you can moderate the comments after logging into your Disqus account.</p><p>Tags:</p><p>List of tags attached to the post. Seperate tags with commas or spaces.</p><p>Overview pages</p><p>Posts are listed by tag, year, month or just chronological. The landing page (firstdoor.com.au/blog) list all posts by published date in reverse chronological  order . When there are more than a certain amount of posts, the remaining posts are listed on further subpages. This is also the case for the tag, year and month pages.</p><p>Teasers</p><p>If you like to list only part of posts on these overview pages insert a teaser separating line in a post where you would like to see the break. They can be entered clicking on the far right button on the editor's toolbar (&lt;&gt;) and entering -----------. At least 3 dashed are needed, use more if you like.Just like the post settings block this block will no be show to the public.</p>
